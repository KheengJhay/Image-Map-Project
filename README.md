# Image-Map-Project

This is an Image Map project, using html and javascript. The main purpose of this project is to create images that can open links. 
When an Image is clicked or tapped the user should be redirected or taken to another webpage. I decided to stick with Wikipedia result pages for each of the logo. For example, the first logo(Mercedes Benz); when it is clicked the user should be taken to the Wikipedia Mercedes Benz result page, same applies to the others;Porsche, Maserati. etc.
For now I have added the Image Map feature to only the the first logo (Mercedes-Benz). 
Though I'm having issues redirecting the user straight to the Wikipedia; Mercedes Benz result page.
